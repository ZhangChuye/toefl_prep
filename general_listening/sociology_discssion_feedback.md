### Listening Material

Listen to a conversation between a student and her sociology professor.
Professor: So Miranda, I take it you wanted to talk with me about the draft of your paper, Herbert Spencer, that's quite an ambitious subject.
Female student: Well, yes, but I just I don't get it. I mean, I worked really hard on it and I thought I understood his ideas pretty well.
Professor: You did. I don't think any of my comments were directed towards your understanding of Spencer's theories, were they?
Female student: Well, uh, maybe not, I guess, but well, in a couple places you wrote and and I guess I just don't get exactly what you meant.
Professor: Yeah, I should have been clearer. The thing is, it's not so much what you've included. It's what you didn't. I mean, basically you haven't presented much more than what's in the textbook. I mean, like here. OK, ideas on individualism, ideas on competition, popular earlier twentieth century then falls out of favor. See, this is all correct, but it's basically just a list of facts. So when I wrote and I was asking why. Why was he popular in the early twentieth century? Why did he fall out a favor?
Female student: Oh, well see... see the thing is when you asked us to choose a sociologist to write about. Well, I didn't really know anything about any of them, so I just picked one, you know, and then I got to reading about his theories and well I I realized I don't agree with a lot of them, but... but I was trying really hard not to let that show in my paper. You know, to be objective and all.
Professor: Ah..well, perhaps you were trying a little too hard. Being objective doesn't mean you're not allowed to be critical.
Professor: Oh, OK. There's no requirement that you agree with what Spencer says. In fact,I want you to think critically.
Female student: Oh, I do. I just, I mean, I didn't want to politicize everything, you know.
Professor: But you don't have to to make a point. A better way to go about it is to provide a little historical perspective. Look, what were the two questions I asked you just a minute ago?
Female student: Ah, why was he popular and then became unpopular?
Professor: Exactly. See in any field, particularly the social sciences, people theories, they come and go and there will always be people who agree with them and people who don't.
Female student: OK, so you mean I should like incorporate other people's reactions to dispense Spencer's theories, like what was it about the early twentieth century that made a lot of people go along with them? And what change later on?
Professor: That's it. It'll help your audience get a handle on Spencer ideas which are pretty complex. Plus, it provides a kind of framework in which you can present your own point of view. You can't very well take sides or expect your audience to if you haven't presented both sides.

### 1. Outline:  
**Original Main Points:**
- **Student's Topic Choice:** The student chose an ambitious subject (Herbert Spencer) for her sociology paper due to unfamiliarity with the field.
- **Confusion about Feedback:** The student is confused about the professor's feedback on her paper, particularly a comment involving "and."
- **Professor’s Explanation:** The professor explains that the issue wasn't the student's understanding of Spencer but that her paper lacked depth beyond listing facts from the textbook.
- **Being Objective vs. Critical:** The professor encourages the student to be critical, explaining that objectivity doesn’t exclude critical thinking.
- **Historical Perspective:** The professor suggests incorporating a historical perspective to help the student explain Spencer’s complex ideas and to provide a framework for her own analysis and viewpoint.

**Points Missed in the Paraphrase:**
- The professor emphasized the importance of explaining why Spencer's ideas were popular at one point and later fell out of favor.
- The student revealed she disagreed with Spencer's ideas but tried to remain objective by not expressing this in the paper.
- The professor suggested that being critical of Spencer’s ideas would not undermine the objectivity of her paper.

### 5. Polished Version:
The conversation takes place between a male professor and a female student. The student seeks clarification regarding the professor’s feedback on her paper about Herbert Spencer, a topic she chose due to her unfamiliarity with sociology. Despite her efforts, she finds the professor’s comment about "and" confusing.

The professor explains that his critique wasn't about her understanding of Spencer’s theories but rather that her paper lacked depth, as it mainly presented facts without further analysis. He clarifies the importance of moving beyond the textbook and encourages the student to think critically, rather than just being objective.

Additionally, the professor suggests that incorporating a historical perspective would help the student explain Spencer’s complex ideas more effectively. By doing so, she could present both sides of the argument, which would also allow her to express her own viewpoint. This approach would not only enhance her paper’s objectivity but also provide a clearer framework for her analysis.
