### Step 1: Outline and Missed Points

**Outline of the Original Listening Material:**
1. **Introduction to Ancient Oral Literature:**
   - Early peoples had oral literature (legends, myths, poems).
   - Stories were primarily passed down orally, memorized, and occasionally written down.

2. **Focus on the Story of Gilgamesh:**
   - Gilgamesh is one of the oldest myths.
   - The story was intended to be recited aloud or even chanted or sung.
   - Hearing the story is crucial to appreciating how ancient people experienced it.

3. **Importance of Sound in Poetry:**
   - Poets craft their work with sound in mind.
   - Even today, poets consider rhymes, rhythms, and sounds, so readers "hear" the poetry when reading.

4. **Appreciation of Ancient Literature Through Sound:**
   - Understanding ancient literature requires knowing what it sounded like.
   - This applies not just to stories but also to poetry and other oral traditions.

5. **Example of Gilgamesh's Immortality Scene:**
   - The professor reads a part of the Gilgamesh myth where the hero laments his failed journey toward immortality.
   - The repetition of the phrase "for whom" emphasizes the hero's sadness.

6. **Translation and Sound Effects:**
   - While the English translation preserves some repetition, many sound effects (like syllabic repetition) are lost when translating from the original language.

**Missed Points in the Paraphrase:**
- The paraphrase misses the idea of **oral literature** being passed down orally.
- The paraphrase overlooks the discussion about **modern poets** and how they consider the sound of their poetry, even if it’s read silently.
- The paraphrase doesn't explicitly mention that **hearing is crucial for understanding poetry and ancient literature**.
- The paraphrase doesn’t clearly capture the part about how **many sound effects are lost in translation** (e.g., repetition of sounds within a word).

| "importance and extension of hearing the sounds"    | "importance of hearing the sounds"                    | "Extension" was incorrectly used; "importance" suffices.  |
| "from the last lecture that include the written"    | "from the last lecture that included the written"     | Verb tense agreement ("include" → "included").            |
| "brought some tapes recording synthesis ancient pronunciation" | "brought some tapes synthesizing ancient pronunciation" | Misuse of “synthesis,” corrected to “synthesizing.”        |
| "She admit the record she was talking"              | "She admitted that the recording she was discussing"  | Past tense "admit" should be "admitted."                  |
| "hearing the original sound is a best way"          | "hearing the original sound is the best way"          | Article correction ("a" → "the").                         |
| "exploring the original sound can be a research paper" | "exploring the original sound could be a topic for a research paper" | Clarity and natural phrasing.                             |
| "she read the English translation first, showing"   | "she first read the English translation, showing"     | Word order adjustment for clarity.                        |
| "like the syllabus"                                | "like the syllables"                                  | Wrong word; corrected to “syllables.”                     |

### Step 4: Rubric Table

| Criteria                      | Rating (out of 5) | Comments                                                                                          |
|-------------------------------|-------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Task Response**              | 3.5               | The paraphrase addresses the lecture but misses key points such as the emphasis on oral tradition.  |
| **Coherence and Cohesion**     | 3.5               | Some ideas are loosely connected; more explicit transitions are needed.                            |
| **Lexical Resource**           | 3.0               | Basic vocabulary is used, with some word choice errors. More varied expressions would enhance clarity. |
| **Grammatical Range and Accuracy** | 3.0          | Frequent grammatical errors detract from readability.                                              |
| **Spelling and Punctuation**   | 3.5               | Several spelling errors and some punctuation issues.                                               |

### Step 5: Polished Version of the Paraphrase

The lecture highlighted the significance of hearing the sounds of ancient texts, especially oral literature, such as legends, myths, and poems, that were mostly memorized and passed down through generations. The professor elaborated on this by referencing the story of Gilgamesh, one of the oldest myths ever told, which was meant to be recited aloud, chanted, or sung. She emphasized that listening to these stories, rather than merely reading translations, allows modern listeners to appreciate how ancient audiences experienced them.

After providing a brief recap from the previous lecture on written records of ancient civilizations, the professor stressed that hearing the original sounds of ancient texts preserves key elements, like rhythm and repetition, that are often lost in translation. She played recordings synthesizing ancient pronunciation for students to engage with. Although she acknowledged that not all recordings were ideal examples, she insisted that hearing the original language is the best way to fully appreciate these texts.

The professor then discussed a specific passage from the Gilgamesh myth, where the hero reflects on his failure to gain immortality, repeatedly asking, "For whom have I labored?" She pointed out that while the English translation preserves some of the repetition, many sound effects, such as syllable repetition, are lost when translated into modern languages. Finally, she suggested that exploring these auditory aspects could serve as an interesting topic for a research paper.
