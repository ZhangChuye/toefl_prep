### Offical Answer

A student says that to encourage students to use the dormitory kitchen more regularly, the administrators can modernize the kitchen with new cookware and provide students with free cooking classes to stimulate some interest. A male student is totally into the idea and he claims that the kitchen is in desperate need of some nice new cookware. It’s super inconvenient to cook in the kitchen right now and he learned this the hard way. One stormy night, he was soaking wet and went to the kitchen to make some tea to warm up, only to find some battered old tea pot and no tea cups at all. Plus, about the free cooking classes, students like the man will just love the idea since most of students don’t even have basic cooking skills. And even better, some students already know quite a lot about cooking, are more than willing to help and can walk people through some recipes, which means that students may have cool things to cook.
