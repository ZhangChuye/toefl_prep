the lecturer highlights significant weaknesses in the three rhino protection strategies proposed in the reading passage.
Firstly, the reaing suggests that dehorning rhinos can protect them by making them less attractive to poachers. However, the lecturer argues that this approach is nither practical nor beneficial for the rhinos. Dehorning requires finding and tranquilizing the animals, wwhich is both time-consuming and costly. Moveover, the loss of their horns would severly impact their ability to perform essential survival tasks, such as digging for water, breaking branches for food, and protecting themselves and their young.
Secondly, while the reaing advocates for educating consumers about the lack of sentific evidence supporting the health benefits of rhino horn, the lecturer counters that such efforts are unlikely to succeed. Many consumers hold deepseated cultural beliefs in the medicinal value of rhino horn. , beliefs that have persisted for thousands of years. Changing these entrenched views through education alone is imporbable.
Lastly, the reading proposes legalizing government sales of rhino horn to lower prics and reduce poaching. Contrary to this, the lecturer warns that legalization could increase demand by making rhino horn more aceptable. This higher demand would drive up prices, thereby incentivizing poachers even more, potentially worsening the situation.
In summary, the lecture casts doubt on the effectiveness of al three proposed solutions due to their practical limitations and the cultural challenges invloved.
