The lecturer is strongly opposed the Spartacus's hero stories. She analyses each of the three ideas in the passage and provides deatiled reasons.
Firstly, the lecturer does not agree the motivation of Spartacus is returning home. Despite the reading passage points out the desire of Spartacus to going back home, she does think there's other reason. based on the historical evidence, Spartacus and his army could have return home during the war. But they didn't. This support the lecturer's point of view where they had other goals such as conquering Roman to get their wealth.
Secondly, She thinks Spartacus is not a good leader for the army. the skills described in the passage should be by accident. He beated roman army at first because their assign the men that are not highly trained, leading the wining at first. The admiration he got was temporary. Later he lost fights as Roman sent more powerful soliders.
The third reason lies in the illusion play. In fact, he is not a hero that want to liberate people. Based on facts, the content described in the passage comes because play writer at that time wnat to mannually set up a hero profile to encourage people to against the slavery. And Spartacus was just happened to be the one that can be the hero. 
In summary, the lecturer opposes the reading passges and conclude that Spartacus was not actually a hero.
