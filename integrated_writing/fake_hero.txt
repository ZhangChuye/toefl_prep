The lecturer is strongly opposed the Spartacus's hero stories. She analyses each of the three ideas in the passage and provides deatiled reasons.
Firstly, the lecturer does not agree the motivation of Spartacus is returning home. Despite the reading passage points out the desire of Spartacus to going back home, she does think there's other reason. based on the historical evidence, Spartacus and his army could have return home during the war. But they didn't. This support the lecturer's point of view where they had other goals such as conquering Roman to get their wealth.
Secondly, She thinks Spartacus is not a good leader for the army. the skills described in the passage should be by accident. He beated roman army at first because their assign the men that are not highly trained, leading the wining at first. The admiration he got was temporary. Later he lost fights as Roman sent more powerful soliders.
The third reason lies in the illusion play. In fact, he is not a hero that want to liberate people. Based on facts, the content described in the passage comes because play writer at that time wnat to mannually set up a hero profile to encourage people to against the slavery. And Spartacus was just happened to be the one that can be the hero. 
In summary, the lecturer opposes the reading passges and conclude that Spartacus was not actually a hero.



The lecturer challenges the heroic depiction of Spartacus in the reading passage, offering three critical counterpoints.

First, while the reading suggests that Spartacus' primary motivation was to return home, the lecturer argues otherwise. 
Based on hisrtorical evidence, Spartacus and his men had a chance to escape but chose to march towards Rome instead.
This suggests that their goals were not only to return home but also to seek revenge and accumulate wealth, which are less admirable motivations.

Second, the lecturer disputes the claim that Spartacus was a brilliant military leader. Although he initially won several battles, these victorise were largely due to the Romans' underestimation of his forces. Spaetacus only defeated poorly trained and weak Roman units. When the Roman army sent its best soldiers, Spartacus was quickly overpowered, indicating that his military success was more a result of luck than strategy.

Lastly, the notion that Spartacus fought for liberate Roman slaves is deemed historically inaccurate. The lecturer points out that this story was created in the 18th century by antislavery advocates in Europe, who needed a historical figure to symbolize their cause. the narrative of Spartacus as a liberator of slaves was fabricated for inspiration rather than based on factual history.

In conclusion, the lecturer refutes the reading's portrayal of Spartacus as a hero, arguing that much of his story has been exaggerated or distorted for dramatic effect.
