There has been some complain about the who should own Amtrak in the US. The professor disagree with thoes ideas and gave a detailed explaination.

Firstly, she point out the purpose of Amtrak is providing service instead of making profits in the passage. Spending money on remote railways makes important and essential service to citizens there. If not owned by goverment, personal owner will cut those routes to save money, which will harm the rights of the needed citizens. In this point of view, the company should not be saled to private owner.

Secondly, she stressed the idea of unfairness to other companies was completely wrong. In fact, government did not only support the airlines by paying some control fee, but also provide weather satellites for them. So thouh the price of Amtrak owned by government is relatively low, it is at the same line with other transportation company like airlines.

Last but not least, the professor also contridicted the point where government should spend money on somewhere else. She pointed the reason why citizens prefers other transportation was the outdated railway system. To avoid this, the government should spend more money on Amtrack. Once the service is good enough, people will crowd in this specific mean of transportation. This also supports that it is better for government to own the Amtrak.

In summary, the professor disagrees the passage in the aspect of expanditure, fairness, and future development. She insisted the ownship of Amtrak should be the government.
